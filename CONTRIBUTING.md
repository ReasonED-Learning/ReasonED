# Thank you for considering contributing to ReasonED! 
Please take a moment to review this document and the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/emrlk/ReasonED/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before submitting a pull request.


# Goals & Responsibilities

There's a lot to be worked on: front-end, back-end, and game development/design! I am not picky at all about the types of contributions right now. I just ask that you keep in mind ReasonED's primary goals:
> * **Foster Critical Thinking:** Empower students to discern between valid and flawed arguments, cultivating critical reasoning skills essential for navigating an information-centered world.

>	* **Facilitate Logical Fallacy Curriculum Integration:** simplify the process of incorporating lessons on logical fallacies into existing curricula, by providing educators with readily available resources to enhance their teaching.
All games and resources must be school-friendly and contain no political references.
 
>	* **Promote Scalable Learning:** With tailored materials spanning elementary to high school levels, ReasonED will ensure a progressive understanding of logical fallacies, enabling continuous skill development across grade levels.

>	* **Ensure User-Friendly Experience:** Prioritize user-friendliness, offering simplified interfaces for educators to guide students of all ages through. Games are fun and easy to learn so they will engage and motivate students.


 ## Responsibilities as contributors:
 > * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Linux.
 > * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
 > * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Reporting Issues
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email reasoned411@gmail.com instead.
To determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions is "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue.
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
> 1. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 2. What did you do?
> 3. What did you expect to see?
> 4. What did you see instead?



# How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement
If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why we need it, and how it should work.


# Code Review Process
As ReasonED is newly open source, only I ([emrlk](https://github.com/emrlk)) look at Pull Requests currently, as they come in. You can expect a response within a few days of submitting. 
I'd love to grant commit access to those who express the interest and ability to improve the project long-term.
