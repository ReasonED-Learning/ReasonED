# ReasonED
<b><h3>CS411 Team Crystal Spring 2024 Prototype</h3></b>
The ReasonED prototype will consist of a visually appealing website with pages dedicated to games, readings, and educator resources respectively. Three two-dimensional games will be developed and embedded on the website, each in which a logical fallacy is personified as a fun character with some flawed tendency that corresponds to the fallacy.
